I've&nbsp;seen benefits across the board for specific issues/ problems I've experienced over the last 9 months. In my first trimester, I had extreme lower back pain due to spending many evenings hunched over on a cold floor. Just having my back, shoulders and neck worked on was extremely effective in relieving that tension and helping me feel less tight overall. In to my second trimester, we tried some massage and Craniosacral therapy focusing on my hips and near my belly. As I started feeling the effects of the increased relaxin hormone in my body, having Heather focus in on areas of pain felt fantastic and anytime she focused energy near my belly, my daughter would kick -- which was a really great experience. I felt like my daughter was getting benefits from this touch as well. I could really feel the positive effects of the massage for days after my appointments. I slept better, had less specific pain-points and was overall more positive because my body simply felt better. &nbsp;I am so grateful to have been able to see her so often and am not sure how I would have made it to 9 months without her help.</span></p>", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fbd9cb153f8 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/var/folders/mn/2k7_2x2s48dbgmyzpw57h2bc0000gn/T/RackMultipart20180828-29793-cnsdpn.jpg>, @original_filename="10934102_10206144228703483_3258809354430931714_o.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"testimonial[image]\"; filename=\"10934102_10206144228703483_3258809354430931714_o.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">, "show"=>"1"}, "commit"=>"Update Testimonial", "locale"=>"en", "id"=>"2"}
